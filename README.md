Test Pyramid
----

Demonstrates how to build tests of different levels (unit, component, system) for apps with rich client. Technologies:
 
- Spring MVC, Hibernate; Groovy JUnit, Spock, Spring Test
- AngularJS; Karma, Protractor

TBD:

- Data validation on back end
- Send regexps for UI to validate inputs
   - Validation error for pyramid name 
- Finish Component Tests that should check whether the regexps are applied on the UI
- Add System Test that checks if validation is applied and regexps are filled
- Color the validation errors
- Add restrictions on how many digits it is possible to put into test counts
